You are given two integer N and M. You have to tell the minimum positive integer let say X, after multiplying with M is divisible by 2^N (2 to the power of N).
More formally, find minimum positive integer X such that (M * X) is perfectly divisible by 2^N (2 to the power of N). As the number can be very large that’s why you have to print X as power of 2. (i.e 8 = 2^3).

Input Format
The first line contains one integer T — the number of test cases.

Each of the next T line have 2 integer N and M.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N, M <= 1e14

Output Format
Output require minimum positive integer as power of 2.
